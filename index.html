<h2>The game I'm playing recently-Final Fantasy XIV</h2>
<p><img src="FF14.png" alt="FF14"></p>
<p>I recently tried the game <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong> and it brought me a whole new experience. This game integrates JRPG and MMORPG very well.<br>
I also like the style of the whole game very much.</p>
<p>I will introduce the excellence of this game from several aspects.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>The plot of Final Fantasy XIV is a more traditional adventure game plot, that is, the hero saves the world. However, because the NPCs in the game are very vividly portrayed and the game settings are very comprehensive, the players have a strong sense of substitution.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The music of the game is very good, whether it is the background music of each map or the music in the battle. Especially the latest raid's background music "Return to Oblivion". The emotion of the character is displayed through music.</p>
<h3>The display of the game</h3>
<p>The display of Final Fantasy XIV fits my liking very well. Both the character and the scene are in line with the "fantasy" in my heart. The variety of races in the game, the scenes that change over time, and even you can see the aurora in the game.</p>

<p>All in all I think Final Fantasy XIV is a great game worth trying. It is the top three MMORPG in my mind.</p>
